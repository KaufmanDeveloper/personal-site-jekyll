I believe in constant improvement. At Knoxville Utilities Board, a concept my boss and mentor always reinforces is "Kaizen", the Sino-Japanese word for "improvement". If you
can improve a little every day, the leaps you can make in a year are vast. Taking this approach to my work life has made every day exciting. Web development is a constantly changing
and evolving field. It requires the willingness and desire to constantly be learning.

One of the other principles I try to live by is ABC: Always Be Coding. On the weekends or after work I'll dedicate time to work on my personal projects. Whether it be a side
web application to help teachers or a video game project, I always want to be exploring new concepts and learning. It's also resulted in me picking up an interest in music, especially
in modular synthesis. My <a href="https://soundcloud.com/astronaut-bicycle" target="_blank">soundcloud</a> has a few of these tracks.
