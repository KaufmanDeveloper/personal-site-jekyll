<p>My career goals involve continually growing as a web developer and providing more complex solutions to people. I'm willing to learn whatever tools it takes to create
things that make peoples' lives easier. I will continue to work on growing as a professional web developer as well as growing as a hobbyist game developer.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio site. Programming is my passion, and I hope to add articles here documenting my struggles and triumphs as a developer.</p>
